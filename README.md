# katerpillar
some things that tickle the brain- _katerpillar_ board design
one of the Mnemonik series keyboards.

done:
+ The initial design points are ready.
+ PCB commisioned/done.
+ silk/mask "dark" design done/uploaded.
+ 2 katerpillar pcb variants: fixed and universal layouts. (fixed with pussible rgb logo led, needs code)
+ proto pcbs done and flashed, fixes discussed/applied

still to do:
correct and clean-up qmk code
vial port
(generic qwerty map or an easier alternative to _mnemonik_ layout, if anyone other wants to try?)
add _katerpillar_ novelty to possible upcoming keyset
