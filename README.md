some things that tickle my brain- _katerpillar_ board design

done:
The initial design points are ready.
PCB commisioned.
silk/mask "dark" variant uploaded.

still to do:
generic qwerty map or an easier alternative to _mnemonik_ layout, if anyone wants to try.
add _katerpillar_ novelty to upcoming keyset.
